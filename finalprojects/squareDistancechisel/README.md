Project square distance
=======================

You've done the chisel [tutorials](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial.git), and now you 
are ready to start your own chisel project.  The following procedure should get you started
with a clean running [Chisel3](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel3.git) project.

## Make your own Chisel3 project
### How to get started
The first thing you want to do is clone this repo into a directory of your own.  I'd recommend creating a chisel projects directory somewhere
```sh
mkdir ~/ChiselProjects
cd ~/ChiselProjects

git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-template.git MyChiselProject
cd MyChiselProject
```
### Make your project into a fresh git repo
There may be more elegant way to do it, but the following works for me. **Note:** this project comes with a magnificent 339 line (at this writing) .gitignore file.
 You may want to edit that first in case we missed something, whack away at it, or start it from scratch.
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .gitignore *
git commit -m 'Starting MyChiselProject'
```
Connecting this up to github or some other remote host is an exercise left to the reader.
### Did it work?
You should now have a project based on Chisel3 that can be run.  **Note:** With a nod to cargo cult thinking, some believe 
it is best to execute the following sbt before opening up this directory in your IDE. I have no formal proof of this assertion.
So go for it, at the command line in the project root.
```sh
sbt test
```
You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines

### It worked!
You are ready to go. We have a few recommended practices and things to do.
* Use packages and following conventions for [structure](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Directories.html) and [naming](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html)
* Package names should be clearly reflected in the testing hierarchy
* Build tests for all your work.
 * This template includes a dependency on the Chisel3 IOTesters, this is a reasonable starting point for most tests
 * You can remove this dependency in the build.sbt file if necessary
* Change the name of your project in the build.sbt
* Change your README.md

## Code explanations
In this code we do two kind of simulations just to test the functionality of our code:
-one with C++ verilator which is what is presented here. This was done by setting the backend to "verilator". verilator simulations are about 6 times faster than the interpreter.
-the other without the verilator, i.e the default scala interpreter.
Both are all much slower than hardware. An FPGA could easily be 1.000 or 10.000 times faster than simulation.

We did a test with 20 times trials with vectors of sizes 150 and we calculated the computation time for both the hardware and the software and we compared to observe that the hardware gradually becames faster.
